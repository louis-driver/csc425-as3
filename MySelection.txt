I chose to use Tailwind as my CSS framework because while Bootstrap
may offer faster development, the modularity is limited compared to Tailwind.
Tailwind offers utility-first classes that should let me construct websites as 
I see fit. As I also have an Art minor and am more interested in front-end 
development, I'd like greater control over designing a website without the 
contraints of bootstrap layouts. My research also showed that Tailwind can 
be used well in conjunction with React due to React's component-based architecture,
which we will be using in future projects.
